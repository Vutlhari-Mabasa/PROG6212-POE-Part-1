# Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)

This project is a **Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)** built using **ASP.NET Core MVC** and **Entity Framework Core**. It allows **lecturers** to submit claims for approval, upload supporting documents, and track the status of their claims. **Programme Coordinators** and **Academic Managers** can verify, approve, and reject claims. 

At this stage, this project is a prototype focusing on the front-end design, with a basic database setup using **SQL Server**. 

Features

1. Lecturer Functionality:
   - Submit new claims.
   - Upload supporting documents (file upload functionality not implemented yet).
   - View all submitted claims.
   - Track the status of claims.

2. Programme Coordinator/Academic Manager Functionality:
   - Verify claims.
   - Approve or reject claims.
   - View all claims in the system.

 Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core MVC: For building the web interface and structure.
- Entity Framework Core: For managing the database and providing an ORM for SQL Server.
- SQL Server: As the relational database for storing data.
